# SuperForth
## About
A minimal, performant, strongly-typed, and functional programming language focused on being practical and pragmatic, yet powerful enough to create readable, performant and concise code for any problem. While SuperForth has as much to do with Forth as Javascript has with Java, it shares the same minimalist, performance oriented approach and philosophy.
